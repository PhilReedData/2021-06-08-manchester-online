## Feedback on Day 1 morning session (shell)

What went well, what did you learn that you are excited about using in your work? 
- Very useful intro from basics to scripts
- Very great introduction to Shell
- Great introduction to shell including very useful commands
- Very useful
- I did not know I could add variables to my script to make it more universal. 
- Dynamic and interactive. Good help system without grieving the whole session. Excited about the pipe system

What could be improved, what was not clear, what needs more explanations?
- Compatability with tutorial-suggested setup (git-bash) esp on Windows
- Fast paced, it was sometimes easy to not follow one step and then miss the next steps
- Too fast sometimes
- I knew what was in the first half already, and some people found the session too fast. Maybe having something to practice on before the course starts would be nice to give everyone some basic knowledge to start with.
- A bit fastpaced at the end.
- Location of downloaded files could be more explicit

## Feedback on Day 1 afternoon session (Python)

What went well, what did you learn that you are excited about using in your work? 
- The pace that the workshop was carried out was brilliant for an absolute beginner, it has built my confidence to do further reading and exploration on using Python.
- good insights regarding the use of the environment around the code: markdowns, auto-completion, report organisation
- I liked the pace of the workshop, the concepts were explained in a clear way. I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forwrd to the next session :)
 
What could be improved, what was not clear, what needs more explanations?
- Could be useful to go through the questions together as a group, some people couldn't find the exercies (just like in the shell part of the workshop)

 ## Feedback on Day 2 afternoon session (Git/Hub)

What went well, what did you learn that you are excited about using in your work? 
- Github seemed quite abstract and scary, but now I feel I can give it a try
- Great introduction from starting a new project to usage in various scenarios for sync/update
-I didn't use github before so at the beginning it seemed a bit scary but it turns out, it's extremely useful. I'll try to learn it a bit more
- Great coverage of Git and extension to question of licensing
 

What could be improved, what was not clear, what needs more explanations?
- I got a bit lost part way through and it took some time to catch up, but because of the online resources and recorded session I'm not worried about losing out, so thanks for those failsafes.
- A lot of material was covered in a very short time, it was easy to get lost
